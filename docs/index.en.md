# mailcow: dockerized - üêÆ + üêã = üíï
**The mailserver suite with the 'moo'**

## What is mailcow: dockerized?

!!! question
	Mailcow, MailCow or mailcow? What is the exact name of the project?

	Correct: **mailcow**, because mailcow is a registered word mark with a small m :grin:

mailcow: dockerized is an open source groupware/email suite based on docker.

mailcow relies on many well known and long used components, which in combination result in an all around carefree email server.

Each container represents a single application, connected in a bridged network.

- [ACME](https://letsencrypt.org/) (Automatic generation of Let's Encrypt certificates)
- [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) (anti-virus scanner) (optional)
- [Dovecot](https://www.dovecot.org/) (IMAP/POP server for retrieving mail)
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) (database to store user information, etc.)
- [Memcached](https://www.memcached.org/) (cache for the SOGo webmailer)
- [Netfilter](https://www.netfilter.org/) (Fail2ban-like integration of [@mkuron](https://github.com/mkuron))
- [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) (Web server for the mailcow UI)
- [Oletools](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools) via [Olefy](https://github.com/HeinleinSupport/olefy) (analyzing office documents for viruses, macros, etc.)
- [PHP](https://php.net/) (programming language for most web-based mailcow actions)
- [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/) (Receiver/sender for mail traffic on the Internet)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) (storage for spam information, DKIM keys, etc.)
- [Rspamd](https://www.rspamd.com/) (spam filter with automatic learning of spam mails)
- [SOGo](https://sogo.nu/) (integrated webmailer and cal/carddav interface)
- [Solr](https://solr.apache.org/) (full-text search for IMAP connections for quick email search) (optional)
- [Unbound](https://unbound.net/) (integrated DNS server to check DNSSEC etc.)
- A watchdog for basic monitoring of container health inside mailcow

But the heart of mailcow is the graphical web interface, the **mailcow UI**.

It offers a place for almost all settings and allows the comfortable creation of new domains and email addresses with just a few clicks.

But also other or more tricky tasks can be done in it with ease:

- [DKIM](http://dkim.org) and [ARC](http://arc-spec.org/) support/generation.
- Black and white lists per domain and per user.
- Spam score management per user (reject spam, flag spam, greylist).
- Allow mailbox users to create temporary spam aliases
- Prepend email tags to subject or move emails to subfolders (per user)
- Allow mailbox users to toggle TLS enforcement for inbound and outbound messages
- Users can reset caches on SOGo ActiveSync devices
- imapsync to periodically migrate or retrieve remote mailboxes
- TFA: Yubikey OTP and WebAuthn USB (Google Chrome and derivatives only), TOTP
- Add whitelist hosts to forward mail to mailcow
- Fail2ban-like integration
- Quarantine system
- Anti-virus scanning including macro scanning in Office documents
- Integrated basic monitoring
- And much more...

The mailcow data (such as emails, user data, etc.) is stored in **Docker volumes** - take good care of these volumes:

- clamd-db-vol-1
- crypt-vol-1
- mysql-socket-vol-1
- mysql-vol-1
- postfix-vol-1
- redis-vol-1
- rspamd-vol-1
- sogo-userdata-backup-vol-1
- sogo-web-vol-1
- solr-vol-1
- vmail-index-vol-1
- vmail-vol-1

!!! warning
	The mails are compressed and encrypted. The key pair can be found in crypt-vol-1. Please don't forget to backup this and other volumes. #nobackupnopity
